[Haikyuu](https://haikyuu.fandom.com/wiki/Haikyuu!!_Wiki) is a japanese manga (genre - sports, comedy). This project started out simply because I liked the manga too much to wait for it to be translated from japanese to english (which took around a week since it was a human process). Unfortumnately the manga finished before I could finish a complete working product :disappointed: . But then it does sound like an amazing idea to be able to convert any manga/manhwa(korean manga) to English so I decided to continue it.

I will keep on updating the progress here (stay tuned or help me out):sweat_smile:
