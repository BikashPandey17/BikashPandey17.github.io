## Here's a visualization I did for Covid19

The idea was to show new confirmed cases throughout the world over time, to bring out the fact that coronavirus is seasonal, it may seem it is over but it may come back. And also to flex on my folium skills (jk `:joy:`). It also demostrates deployement on github pages.
