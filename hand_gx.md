### Introduction

**Background:** We have come a long way from conventional image processing where we only performed mathematical functions on the pixels and their clusters but with the help of present day and computing power and capability we can make more sense and infer more about the images by the use of deep learning as we cultivate the pixels as huge tensors i.e multidimensional vectors and use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to map images to specific alphanumeric signs through which we achieve gesture control.

Gesture recognition is one
such topic that falls under computer vision that allows users to control and interact with any device without actually touching them.
We attempt at providing an efficient hand gesture recognition system where the users can tweak the real time processing according to their environment and use it accordingly.
This project focuses on implementing a real time application that recognizes 48 different gesture inputs which include English Alphabets(A
-Z), Numbers(0-9) and special characters like(',', space, new line,... etc) which inturn aids in the communication of people who are
audibly or vocally impaired acting as the medium of translation. Moreover the application also allows people to continously use it as a
real time keyboard without actual "Keys". The technology has vast areas in which it can be integrated seemlessly, viz. Security - encyption using gestures, 
Gaming - hands free control for more immersive experience, 
Medicine - generalised epileptic seizure detection,
etc but in this case we have devoted our research towards welfare of the specially abled exclusively the audibly and speech imapaired to aid their communication.
Given the fact this piece of software is driven only by mathematical algorithms without using much of external peripherals like kinect depth camera etc reduces the cost drastically and helps the application to reach a greater demographic as this requires only a basic camera either a webcam or an inbuilt camera.

**Objectives:** We attempt at providing an efficient hand gesture recognition system where the users can calibrate the real time processing according to their environment and use it accordingly.
This project focuses on implementing a real time module that recognizes 48 different gesture inputs which include English Alphabets(A
-Z), Numbers(0-9) and special characters like(',', space, new line,... etc) which inturn aids in the communication of people who are
audibly or vocally impaired acting as the medium of translation. Moreover the application also allows people to continously use it as a
real time keyboard without actual "Keys".

**Survey Of Technologies:** Gesture Recognition has been growing as a research/application for several years. The two major branches include video processing and
CNN to recognize different classes. Such discipline have their foundation in various technologies and have evolved into various advanced
forms in modern technology.
In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of deep neural networks, most commonly applied to analyzing visual imagery.Convolutional networks were inspired by biological processes in that the connectivity pattern between neurons resembles the organization of the animal visual cortex. 
OpenCV (Open source computer vision) is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez
