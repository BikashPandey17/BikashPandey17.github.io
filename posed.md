## Posedetection

This Idea here is to calculate the angle made by the motion of your head - this is a fundamental idea which demonstrates the simplicity of deployement of the deep learning model in order to inspire some insane ideas like -
 
 - Work out Assistant 
 - Health app
 - AR game (that makes you excercise :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:) `:baseball:`
 - Cricket Chucking Detection [Github](https://github.com/fear-the-lord/Lets-not-Chuck) 

Look into the Builds of the project to checkout how I used github pages for the deployement along with tensorflow.js. Also ideas for the above lists are much appreciated `:blush:` .
